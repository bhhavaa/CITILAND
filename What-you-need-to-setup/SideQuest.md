**SideQuest is the software you need to deploy your project from Unity to your Oculus Headset.**

In Unity, go to file > build settings

Make sure the settings is the same as you see here. Then Click Build.

After clicking build, create a folder in your project folder. This folder is to store all your apk files. To not create many files, just overwrite the same apk file.

You also have to make sure you connect the USB-C from PC to Oculus Headset. Once connected, SideQuest will show charging.
